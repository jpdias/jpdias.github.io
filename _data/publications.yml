    abstract: "Performing experiments with Internet-of-Things edge devices is not always a trivial task as large physical testbeds or complex simulators are often needed, leading to low reproducibility and several difficulties in crafting complex scenarios and tweaking parameters. Most available simulators try to simulate as close to reality as possible. While we agree that this kind of high-fidelity simulation might be necessary for some scenarios, we argue that a low-fidelity easy-to-change simulator may be a good solution when rapid prototyping orchestration strategies and algorithms. In this work, we introduce SIMoT, a low-fidelity orchestrator simulator created to achieve shorter feedback loops when testing different orchestration strategies for task allocation in edge devices. We then transferred the simulator-validated algorithms to both physical and virtual testbeds, where it was possible to assert that the simulator results correlate strongly with the observations on those testbeds."

    abstract: "The widespread use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) across different application domains leads to an increased concern regarding their dependability, especially as the number of potentially mission-critical systems becomes considerable. Fault-tolerance has been used to reduce the impact of faults in systems, and their adoption in IoT is becoming a necessity. This work focuses on how to exercise fault-tolerance mechanisms by deliberately provoking its malfunction. We start by describing a proof-of-concept fault-injection add-on to a commonly used publish/subscribe broker. We then present several experiments mimicking real-world IoT scenarios, focusing on injecting faults in systems with (and without) active self-healing mechanisms and comparing their behavior to the baseline without faults. We observe evidence that fault-injection can be used to (a) exercise in-place fault-tolerance apparatus, and (b) detect when these mechanisms are not performing nominally, providing insights into enhancing in-place fault-tolerance techniques."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are considered one of the most notable examples of complex, large-scale systems. Some authors have proposed visual programming (VP) approaches to address part of their inherent complexity. However, in most of these approaches, the orchestration of devices and system components is still dependent on a centralized unit, preventing higher degrees of dependability. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) of the current approaches that provide visual and decentralized orchestration to define and operate IoT systems, reflecting upon a total of 29 proposals. We provide an in-depth discussion of these works and find out that only four of them attempt to tackle this issue as a whole, although still leaving a set of open research challenges. Finally, we argue that addressing these challenges could make IoT systems more fault-tolerant, with an impact on their dependability, performance, and scalability."

    abstract: "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has transformed everyday manual tasks into digital and automatable ones, giving way to the birth of several end-user development solutions that attempt to ease the task of configuring and automating IoT systems without requiring prior technical knowledge. While some studies reflect on the automation rules that end-users choose to program into their spaces, they are limited by the number of devices and possible rules that the tool under study supports. There is a lack of systematic research on (1) the automation rules that users wish to configure on their homes, (2) the different ways users state their intents, and (3) the complexity of the rules themselves—without the limitations imposed by specific IoT devices systems and end-user development tools. This paper surveyed twenty participants about home automation rules given a standard house model and device’s list, without limiting their creativity and resulting automation complexity. We analyzed and systematized the collected 177 scenarios into seven different interaction categories, representing the most common smart home interactions."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems have spread among different application domains, from home automation to industrial manufacturing processes. The rushed development by competing vendors to meet the market demand of IoT solutions, the lack of interoperability standards, and the overall lack of a defined set of best practices have resulted in a highly complex, heterogeneous, and frangible ecosystem. Several works have been pushing towards visual programming solutions to abstract the underlying complexity and help humans reason about it. As these solutions begin to meet widespread adoption, their building blocks usually do not consider reliability issues. Node-RED, being one of the most popular tools, also lacks such mechanisms, either built-in or via extensions. In this work we present SHEN (Self-Healing Extensions for Node-RED) which provides 17 nodes that collectively enable the implementation of self-healing strategies within this visual framework. We proceed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach using real devices and fault injection techniques."

    abstract: "In this work, we propose a method for extending Node-RED to allow the automatic decomposition and partitioning of the system towards higher decentralization. We provide a custom firmware for constrained devices to expose their resources, as well as new nodes and modifications in the Node-RED engine that allow automatic orchestration of tasks. The firmware is responsible for low-level management of health and capabilities, as well as executing MicroPython scripts on demand. Node-RED then takes advantage of this firmware by (1) providing a device registry allowing devices to announce themselves, (2) generating MicroPython code from dynamic analysis of flow and nodes, and (3) automatically (re-)assigning nodes to devices based on pre-specified properties and priorities. A mechanism to automatically detect abnormal run-time conditions and provide dynamic self-adaptation was also explored. Our solution was tested using synthetic home automation scenarios, where several experiments were conducted with both virtual and physical devices. We then exhaustively measured each scenario to allow further understanding of our proposal and how it impacts the system’s resiliency, efficiency, and elasticity."

    abstract: "Infrastructure-as-Code tools, such as Docker and Docker Compose, play a crucial role in the development and orchestration of cloud-native and at-scale software. However, as IaC relies mostly on the development of text-only specifications, these are prone to misconfigurations and hard to debug. Several works suggest the use of models as a way to abstract their complexity, and some point to the use of visual metaphors. Yet, few empirical studies exist in this domain. We propose a visual programming notation and environment for specifying Docker Compose configurations and proceed to empirically validate its merits when compared with the standard text-only specification. The goal of this work is to produce evidence of the impact that visual approaches may have on the development of IaC. We observe that the use of our solution reduced the development time and error proneness, primarily for configurations definition activities. We also observed a preference for the approach in terms of ease of use, a positive sentiment of its usefulness and intention to use."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things systems are assemblies of highly-distributed and heterogeneous parts that, in orchestration, work to provide valuable services to end-users in many scenarios. These systems depend on the correct operation of sensors, actuators, and third-party services, and the failure of a single one can hinder the proper functioning of the whole system, making error detection and recovery of paramount importance, but often overlooked. By drawing inspiration from other research areas, such as cloud, embedded, and mission-critical systems, we present a set of patterns for self-healing IoT systems. We discuss how their implementation can improve system reliability by providing error detection, error recovery, and health mechanisms maintenance."

    abstract: "The continuous spreading of the Internet-of-Things across application domains, aided by the continuous growth on the number of devices and systems that are Internet-connected, created both a rise in the complexity of these systems and made noticeable a lack of human resources with the expertise to design, develop and maintain them. Recent works try to mitigate these issues by creating solutions that abstract the complexity of the systems, such as using visual programming languages. Node-RED, as one of the most common solutions for the visual development IoT systems, stills has several limitations, such as the lack of observability and inadequate debugging mechanisms. In this work, we address some of these limitations by enhancing Node-RED with new features that improve the user's system development, debugging, and understanding tasks. We proceed to empirically evaluate the impact of these enhancements, concluding that, overall, such enhancements reduce the development time and the number of failed attempts to deploy the system."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things systems are comprised of highly heterogeneous architectures, where different protocols, application stacks, integration services, and orchestration engines co-exist. As they permeate our everyday lives, more of them become safety-critical, increasing the need for making them testable and fault-tolerant, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we present a set of self-healing extensions for Node-RED, a popular visual programming solution for IoT systems. These extensions add runtime verification mechanisms and self-healing capabilities via new reusable nodes, some of them leveraging meta-programming techniques. With them, we were able to implement self-modification of flows, empowering the system with self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities, that search for malfunctions, and take subsequent actions towards the maintenance of health and recovery. We tested these mechanisms on a set of scenarios using a live physical setup that we called SmartLab. Our results indicate that this approach can improve a system’s reliability and dependability, both by being able to detect failing conditions, as well as reacting to them by self-modifying flows, or triggering countermeasures."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things has reshaped the way people interact with their surroundings. In a smart home, controlling the lights is as simple as speaking to a conversational assistant since everything is now Internet-connected. But despite their pervasiveness, most of the existent IoT systems provide limited out-of-the-box customization capabilities. Several solutions try to attain this issue leveraging end-user programming features that allow users to define rules to their systems, at the cost of discarding the easiness of voice interaction. However, as the number of devices increases, along with the number of household members, the complexity of managing such systems becomes a problem, including finding out why something has happened. In this work we present Jarvis, a conversational interface to manage IoT systems that attempts to address these issues by allowing users to specify time-based rules, use contextual awareness for more natural interactions, provide event management and support causality queries. A proof-of-concept was used to carry out a quasi-experiment with non-technical participants that provides evidence that such approach is intuitive enough to be used by common end-users."

Based on existent solutions (and inspired in other closely-related domains), we describe two common strategies that developers can use for testing IoT systems, (1) Testbed and (2) Simulation-based Testing, as well as one recurrent solution for its deployment (3) Middleman Update."

    abstract: "Any software system that has a considerable growing number of features will suffer from essential complexity, which makes the understanding of the software artifacts increasingly costly and time-consuming. A common approach for reducing the software understanding complexity is to use software visualizations techniques. There are already several approaches for visualizing software, as well as for extracting the information needed for those visualizations. This paper presents a novel approach to tackle the software complexity, delving into the common approaches for extracting information about software artifacts and common software visualization metaphors, allowing users to dive into the software system in a live way using virtual reality (VR). Experiments were carried out in order to validate the correct extraction of metadata from the software artifact and the corresponding VR visualization. With this work, we intend to present a starting point towards a Live Software Development app roach."

    abstract: "Cloud computing has emerged as the de facto approach for providing services over the Internet. Although having increased popularity, challenges arise in the management of such environments, especially when the cloud service providers are constantly evolving their services and technology stack in order to maintain position in a demanding market. This usually leads to a combination of different services, each one managed individually, not providing a big picture of the architecture. In essence, the end state will be too many resources under management in an overwhelming heterogeneous environment. An infrastructure that has considerable growth will not be able to avoid its increasing complexity. Thus, this papers introduces liveness as an attempt to increase the feedback-loop to the developer in the management of cloud architectures. This aims to ease the process of developing and integrating cloud-based systems, by giving the possibility to understand the system and manage it in an int eractive and immersive experience, thus perceiving how the infrastructure reacts to change. This approach allows the real-time visualization of a cloud infrastructure composed of a set of Amazon Web Services resources, using visual city metaphors."

    abstract: "The Internet of Things is progressively getting broader, evolving its scope while creating new markets and adding more to the existing ones. However, both generation and analysis of large amounts of data, which are integral to this concept, may require the proper protection and privacy-awareness of some sensitive information. In order to control the access to this data, allowing devices to verify the reliability of their own interactions with other endpoints of the network is a crucial step to ensure this required safeness. Through the implementation of a blockchain-based Public Key Infrastructure connected to the Keybase platform, it is possible to achieve a simple protocol that binds devices’ public keys to their owner accounts, which are respectively supported by identity proofs. The records of this blockchain represent digital signatures performed by this Keybase users on their respective devices’ public keys, claiming their ownership. Resorting to this distributed and decentralized PKI, any device is able to autonomously verify the entity in control of a certain node of the network and prevent future interactions with unverified parties."

In environments as these, the collaboration between different entities creates an opportunity for innovation, where data interoperability allows for the re-use of information, the possibility of different services taking advantage of other third-party sources and the development of new businesses from existing information. This, however, is only possible if there is some sort of interoperability between the data, a way for it to be transmitted from entity to entity, always with the possibility of creating value with its manipulation and consumption.

The appearance of serverless architectures, specifically highlighting FaaS, raises the question of the suitability of using them in IoT environments. Combining IoT with a serverless architectural design can effective when trying to make use of local processing power that exists in a local network of IoT devices and creating a fog layer that leverages computational capabilities that are closer to the end-user. In this approach, which is placed between the device and the serverless function, when a device requests for the execution of a serverless function will decide based on previous metrics of execution if the serverless function should be executed locally, in the fog layer of a local network of IoT devices, or if it should be executed remotely, in one of the available cloud servers. Therefore, this approach allows dynamically allocating functions to the most suitable layer."

By using such approaches, and leveraging concepts as reactive design, visual notations, and live programming, we believe to be able to reduce the complexity of creating, operate/monitor and evolve such systems. The main objective of this Ph.D. is to delve into the software engineering practices for developing IoT systems and systems of systems, exploiting models as a suitable abstraction, expecting to reduce the complexity of managing most of the software development lifecycle that targets IoT systems and to develop the prototype that will aid on the validation of such approach."

    abstract: "Systems are error-prone. Big systems have lots of errors. The Internet-of-Things poses us one of the biggest and widespread systems, where errors directly impact people's lives. Testing and validating is how one deals with errors; but testing and validating a planetary-scale, heterogeneous, and evergrowing ecosystem has its own challenges and idiosyncrasies. As of today, the solutions available for testing these systems are insufficient and fragmentary. In this paper we provide an overview on test approaches, tools and methodologies for the Internet-of-Things, its software and its devices. Our conclusion is that we are still lagging behind on the best practices and lessons learned from the Software Engineering community in the past decades."

    abstract: "Internet of Things is a paradigm that empowers the Internet-connected heterogeneous devices alongside with their capabilities to sense the physical world and act on it. Internet of Things has a wide range of application in a variety of areas and contexts, such as smart spaces like smart homes and smart cities. These systems have to deal with device-related problems, such as heterogeneity, fault-tolerance, privacy and security. This paper addresses some patterns about some recurring problems when designing and implementing Internet of Things systems. More concretely, the patterns address how to deal with highly-changeable, error-prone and failing devices and their networks. Device Registry demonstrates how to deal with devices that can change over time. Device Raw Data Collector explains how to check the health of heterogeneous devices by a constant collection of raw device data. Device Error Data Supervisor shows how to leverage the continuous data-flow coming from devices to enable error detection and, consequently, processing and handling those errors. Lastly, Predictive Device Monitor show how to pro-actively predict devices operation behavior enabling maintenance actions."

    abstract: "In order to increase sales and profits, it is common that e-commerce website owners resort to several marketing and advertising techniques, attempting to influence user actions. Summarizing and analysing user behaviour is a complex task since it is hard to extrapolate patterns that never occurred before and the causality aspects of the system are not usually taken into consideration. There has been studies about characterizing user behaviour and interactions in e-commerce websites that could be used to improve this process. This paper presents an agent-based framework for simulating models of user behaviour created through data mining processes within an e-commerce context. The purpose of framework is to study the reaction of user to stimuli that influence their actions while navigating the website. Furthermore a scalability analysis is performed on a case-study."

    abstract: "E-commerce website owners rely heavily on analysing and summarising the behaviour of costumers, making efforts to influence user actions and optimize success metrics. Machine learning and data mining techniques have been applied in this field, greatly influencing the Internet marketing activities. When faced with a new e-commerce website, the data scientist starts a process of collecting real-time and historical data about it, analysing and transforming this data in order to get a grasp into the website and its users. Data scientists commonly resort to tracking domain-specific events, requiring code modification of the web pages. This paper proposes an alternative approach to retrieve information from a given e-commerce website, collecting data from the site's structure, retrieving semantic information in predefined locations and analysing user's access logs, thus enabling the development of accurate models for predicting users’ future behaviour. This is accomplished by the application of a web mining process, comprehending the site's structure, content and usage in a pipeline, resulting in a web graph of the website, complemented with a categorization of each page and the website's archetypical user profiles."

    abstract: "A botnet consists of a network of computers that run a special software that allows a third-party to remotely control them. This characteristic presents a major issue regarding security in the Internet. Although common malicious software infect the network with almost immediate visible consequences, there are cases where that software acts stealthy without direct visible effects on the host machine. This is the normal case of botnets. However, not always the bot software is created and used for illicit purposes. There is a need for further exploring the concepts behind botnets and network security. For this purpose, this paper presents and discusses an educational tool that consists of an open-source botnet software kit with built-in functionalities. The tool enables anyone with some computer technical knowledge, to experiment and find out how botnets work and can be changed and adapted to a variety of useful applications, such as introducing and exemplifying security and distributed systems’ concepts."

    abstract: "Container orchestration tools supporting infrastructure-as-code allow new forms of collaboration between developers and operatives. Still, their text-based nature permits naive mistakes and is more difficult to read as complexity increases. We can find few examples of low-code approaches for defining the orchestration of containers, and there seems to be a lack of empirical studies showing the benefits and limitations of such approaches. We hypothesize that a complete visual notation for Docker-based orchestrations could reduce the effort, the error rate, and the development time. Therefore, we developed a tool featuring such a visual notation for Docker Compose configurations, and we empirically evaluated it in a controlled experiment with novice developers. The results show a significant reduction in development time and error-proneness when defining Docker Compose files, supporting our hypothesis. The participants also thought the prototype easier to use and useful, and wanted to use it in the future."

    abstract: "Cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), supported by technologies such as Docker, have shaped how many software systems are built and deployed. Previous research has identified typical issues for some types of IaC specification but not why they come to be, or they have delved into collaboration aspects but not into technical ones. This work aims to characterize the activities around two particular kinds of IaC specification—Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files. We seek to know how they can be better supported and therefore study also what approaches and tools practitioners employ. We used an online questionnaire to gather data. The first part of the study reached 68 graduate students from a study program on informatics engineering, and the second one 120 professional software developers. The results show that most of the activities of the process of developing a Dockerfile are perceived as time-consuming, especially when the respondents are beginners with this technology. We also found that solving issues using trial-and-error approaches is very common and that many developers do not use ancillary tools to support the development of Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files."

    abstract: "Internet-of-Things has reshaped the way people interact with their surroundings and automatize the once manual actions. In a smart home, controlling the Internet-connected lights is as simple as speaking to a nearby conversational assistant. However, specifying interaction rules, such as making the lamp turn on at specific times or when someone enters the space is not a straightforward task. The complexity of doing such increases as the number and variety of devices increases, along with the number of household members. Thus, managing such systems becomes a problem, including finding out why something has happened. This issue lead to the birth of several low-code development solutions that allow users to define rules to their systems, at the cost of discarding the easiness and accessibility of voice interaction. In this paper we extend the previous published work on Jarvis [1], a conversational interface to manage IoT systems that attempts to address these issues by allowing users to specify time-based rules, use contextual awareness for more natural interactions, provide event management and support causality queries. A proof-of-concept is presented, detailing its architecture and natural language processing capabilities. A feasibility experiment was carried with mostly non-technical participants, providing evidence that Jarvis is intuitive enough to be used by common end-users, with participants showcasing an overall preference by conversational assistants over visual low-code solutions."

    abstract: "Cloud computing has been playing a significant role in the provisioning of services over the Internet since its birth. However, developers still face several challenges limiting its full potential. The difficulties are mostly due to the large, ever-growing, and ever-changing catalog of services offered by cloud providers. As a consequence, developers must deal with different cloud services in their systems; each managed almost individually and continually growing in complexity. This heterogeneity may limit the view developers have over their system architectures and make the task of managing these resources more complex. This work explores the use of liveness as a way to shorten the feedback loop between developers and their systems in an interactive and immersive way, as they develop and integrate cloud-based systems. The designed approach allows real-time visualization of cloud infrastructures using a visual city metaphor. To assert the viability of this approach, the authors conceived a proof-of-concept and carried on experiments with developers to assess its feasibility."

We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are prone to system’s and network’s faults and do not assure the integrity of policies life-cycle. By approaching this problem with a blockchain where the operations are stored as transactions, we can ensure that the different facilities have knowledge about all the parts that can act over the eHealth resources while maintaining integrity, auditability, and authenticity."

Some of these systems have highly-complex tasks of monitorization and control and need to be programmed accordingly. The use of visual programming, such as workflows, is common in these systems due to the abstraction they provide to the systems programmer. However, such programming environments have several deficiencies on what regards debugging capabilities, mostly due to the constraints that difficult the use of traditional mechanisms. The work presented in this paper approaches these issues, delving into the design and implementation of a multi-strategy debugging mechanism into a commercial-grade Manufacturing Execution System. To validate the approach, a proof-of-concept was then developed and validated against different debugging scenarios."

    abstract: "Internet of Things (IoT) is a cutting-edge paradigm originating from the advances in information and communication technologies, towards a worldwide network of inter-connected heterogeneous entities. From this context an old area of networks as emerged again being that the concept of mesh networks. In such topology each node relays data for the network. These nodes collaborate in the dissemination of data by either wired or wireless networks. For a broad range of low-data-rate, low-power IoT applications mesh networking is coming forth as an alluring option for it has the purpose of enabling connected devices to communicate with each other not leaning on dedicated hub services or computers. Being inexpensive this solution thus provides a straightforward approach when building a network of connected devices. Our case study consisted of connecting five ESP8266 relying on communication through end-to-end MQTT queues. These ESP8266 were to collect different types of data through their sensors  and to act, through their relayed actuators, upon that same data. Two approaches were considered for this implementation relying both in open source libraries. The first one was ESP8266MQTTMesh being that problems emerged from its deployment. The second one was painlessMesh and it worked as expected for being able to easily extract information on how the network was structured and changed during its life-cycle, thus meaning we could visualize the network and the messages going through it. With this mesh as a functional proof of concept a visualization system was developed using Elasticsearch and Kibana as well as an elemental web application with the sole purpose of providing visualization of quasi-real-time of the network mesh behavior. The feasibility of use of mesh networks in IoT scenarios like smart houses was demonstrated. However, there is still space for exploring large-scale test scenarios.."

    abstract: "A Botnet is, by definition, a collection of computers that varies from tens to millions. It runs special software that effectively allows the machines to be remotely controlled. In the most common situation, computers are recruited for a Botnet by an attacker that is able to exploit vulnerabilities, either of the system software or of human users (by social engineering), to infect the computers with the special crafted software that allows the remote control of the individual machines (now, 'bots'). Types of malicious usage of these Botnets are: spam (delivery of unsolicited email), manipulation of online polls/contests, denial of service attacks. But there are also cases where 'botnet software' is installed on purpose and authorized by the computers' owners, to be used for beneficial purposes. Such is the case of the SETI@home initiative. There is a need for an easy way to learn about Botnets: what they are, how they work, how they can be given good use. For that, we have developed an educational software project that on one hand, consists of a wiki with information on botnets, its anatomy, architecture and impact on the Internet. On the other hand, consists of an open-source botnet software kit with built-in functionalities useful to anyone with some computer technical knowledge, to experiment and find out how botnets work and can be changed and adapted to a variety of useful applications, such as introducing and exemplifying security and distributed systems' concepts."
