UBERHid is a Wifi keylogger with keyboard and mouse injection capabilities desinged and implemented by [@kripthor](https://twitter.com/kripthor). The project is still in early phases of development however it already allows on to perform keylogging and inject keyboard/mouse payloads. I had the opportunity to meet @kripthor during the [BSides Lisbon](https://bsideslisbon.org/) 2019 and to get one UBERHid DIY kit.

Malicious Programmable HID (Human Interface Device) are, typically, microcontrollers programmed to act as a USB HID keyboard and mouse, and set to send certain keystrokes and mouse movement. These can work on a _plug and deploy_ basis (_e.g._ the classic [USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe)), can act when some variable changes (_e.g._ deploy a script when the ambient light goes bellow a given threshold[^5]) or be remotely accessible (_e.g._ WiFi). Cheap versions of these devices include the ones based on [Digispark Attiny85](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/17/diy-rubber-ducky-is-as-cheap-as-its-namesake/), and I did something to make it *easy* to deploy new Ducky Scripts[^6].

_The advantage of a USB HID is that it does not matter if autorun is disabled or not. By default, most operating systems seem to automatically install and configure USB HIDs as soon as they are inserted, regardless of the privilege level of the current user._[^1]

Adrian Crenshaw has an article section on how to detect and mitigate this kind of malicious devices[^1], and [@pmsosa](https://github.com/pmsosa) created a daemon that can defeat these devices[^4]. Even so, these only protect the injection of payloads, not the keylogging part.

As far as I could find there is only one solution in the market that does something similar, and it's too expensive (price ranges from 70 to 105 EUR): [KEYVILBOARD](https://keyvilboard.nl/en/). However, the most expensive version has some extra features, such as support for 2G communication.

## Schematics

### UBERHid Wiring 

Details of the wiring between the ATmega32u4 and FTDI programmer. Note that the ATmega used in this case was an SS Micro version which does not have the same pinout as the recommended DM Micro AU Beetle Leonardo, which fits directly in the PCB pinout layout.

## Soldering

The components must be soldered accordingly to the above schematic. Some extra details and _protips_:

- Start by sodering the smaller components, especially the MAX3421 chip, the SMD resistors and capacitors and the XTAL crystal.
- Two pins stay right bellow the ESP8266 chip. You have to be sure that these pins do not make any contact with the ESP8266 after the soldering is completed. I used a little of heat-resistant isolator tape to avoid any contact and soldered the pins on the other side of the board.
- Solder the ESP8266 before the remaining pinouts to have more space. 
- Finish the soldering by adding the remaining pins and the USB port.
- The atmega32u4 can be soldered directly on top of the UBERHid PCB, although some jumper cables can also be used to make it possible to reuse it to other projects.
- Clean the board using isopropyl alcohol.

## How to program the devices

### Using [Platformio](https://platformio.org/)

#### ESP8266

0. Connect the FTDI to the PCB pins as depicted in the wiring scheme above.
1. ```GPIO0``` needs to be grounded to get into programming mode.
2. Uncomment the follwing lines in ```platformio.ini```:
```yaml
src_dir = ${workspacedir}/firmware/UberHID-ESPUSB/.
data_dir = ${workspacedir}/firmware/UberHID-ESPUSB/data/.
```
3. ```$ platformio run -e esp12e``` _sanity check_
4. ```$ platformio run -e esp12e --target upload --upload-port <dev/ttyUSB*>``` _uploads firmware_
 - Replace ```<dev/ttyUSB*>``` with your device, _e.g._: ```dev/ttyUSB0```
5. ```$ pio run -e esp12e --target uploadfs --upload-port <dev/ttyUSB*>``` _uploads filesystem (data folder)_
 - Replace ```<dev/ttyUSB*>``` with your device, _e.g._: ```dev/ttyUSB0```

#### Arduino Leonardo (ATmega32u4)

0. Plug-in the Arduino Leonardo in one of the computer USB ports.
1. Uncomment the follwing line in ```platformio.ini```:
```yaml
src_dir = ${workspacedir}/firmware/UberHID-Leonardo/.
```
2. ```$ platformio run -e leonardo``` _sanity check_
3. ```$ platformio run -e leonardo --target upload --upload-port <dev/ttyACM*>```
 - Replace ```<dev/ttyACM*>``` with your device, _e.g._: ```dev/ttyACM0```


## How to use it?

0. Connect the device between a keyboard and a computer. 
 ```
 ----------     ---------     ----------
 |Keyboard| <-> |UBERHid| <-> |Computer|
 ----------     ---------     ----------
 ```
1. Connect to the device access point.
 - It can be visible or hidden depending on the configuration on file ```Config.h``` in ```firmware/UberHID-ESPUSB```. Other configurations available are the access point name and password.

    ```c
    #define WIFISSID "UBERHID"
    #define WIFIPASS "uberidiota"
    #define WIFICHANNEL 7
    #define WIFISSIDHIDDEN 0 //1 for hidden
    ``` 
2. Navigate to ```192.168.4.1```

3. You can see the keystrokes in realtime and inject keyboard and mouse commands. Also, you can RickRoll your friends.

## Final Result

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I still need to reduce the jumper _chaos_ with smaller jumpers or with the other version of the ATmega32u4 that plugs directly into the designed PCB. And a 3D-printed case!

There are still a lot of features under development, such as adding support for Wifi attacks that can be performed using an ESP8266[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3].
